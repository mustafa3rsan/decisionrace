# Decision Race

> Can't agree with your senior? Don't want to make the decision yourself? Let physics decide for you.

A physics-based decision maker for the chronically indecisive. Drop two options into a Plinko-style race and let gravity pick the winner.

## Why?

- `agent_type` vs `source_agent`? **Race it.**
- Tabs vs spaces? **Race it.**
- Merge or rebase? **Race it.**
- Your opinion vs senior's opinion? **Race it** (and blame physics).
